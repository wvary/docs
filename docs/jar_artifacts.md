# Artifacts

Artifacts can be used to provide libraries, rules, schemas, and custom code to applications.  Artifact JARs follow Apache Maven standards, which require groupId, artifactId, and version to be specified and can be uploaded manually and synchronized automatically from a Maven artifacts directory accessible by the Gateway.
